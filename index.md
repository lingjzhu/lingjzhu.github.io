## About Me

Hi there! I am currently an assistant professor at the [Linguistics Department at the University of British Columbia](https://linguistics.ubc.ca/) and an instructor for the UBC [MDS-CL Program](https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/programs/computational-linguistics). I am primarily interested in multilingualism, speech and language processing, and computational social sciences. Trained as both a linguist and an engineer, I combine linguistic theories with data-driven methods in NLP, network science and machine learning.

Before that, I was a post-doctoral research fellow at [Blablablab](https://blablablab.si.umich.edu/), UMSI. I had obtained my Ph.D. in Linguistics and Scientific Computing from the [Department of Linguistics](https://lsa.umich.edu/linguistics) and the [Michigan Institute for Computational Discovery & Engineering](https://micde.umich.edu/) at University of Michigan-Ann Arbor. During my Ph.D. years, I was fortunately advised by [Pam Beddor](https://lsa.umich.edu/linguistics/people/faculty/core-faculty/beddor.html) and [David Jurgens](https://jurgens.people.si.umich.edu/).
