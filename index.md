## About Me

Hi there! I am currently an assistant professor at the [Linguistics Department at the University of British Columbia](https://linguistics.ubc.ca/), a member of [UBC NLP Group](https://nlp.cs.ubc.ca/), and an instructor for the UBC [MDS-CL Program](https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/programs/computational-linguistics). I am primarily interested in multilingual speech processing, natural language processing, and computational social sciences. 

Before joining UBC, I was a post-doctoral research fellow at [Blablablab](https://blablablab.si.umich.edu/), UMSI. I had obtained my Ph.D. in Linguistics and Scientific Computing from the [Department of Linguistics](https://lsa.umich.edu/linguistics) and the [Michigan Institute for Computational Discovery & Engineering](https://micde.umich.edu/) at University of Michigan-Ann Arbor. During my Ph.D. years, I was fortunately advised by [Pam Beddor](https://lsa.umich.edu/linguistics/people/faculty/tenure-track-faculty/beddor.html) and [David Jurgens](https://jurgens.people.si.umich.edu/). 

## Research Interests

- **Speech and language processing:** multilingual ASR, phone recognition, multilingual TTS, narrative understanding
- **Computational social sciences:** text as data, entertainment computing, game studies, computational sociolinguistics
